With the way that my code is structured in Python, it is hard for me send an .exe.
Currently, the only way to actually run the code is this:
1. Download and install Pycharm from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
2. Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (3.6.4)
3. Open Pycharm, make a new project.
4. Right click on the project file (should be what you named it, already highlighted, and on top of External Libraries) and make a new a new Python File (New>Python File)
6. Copy and paste in the code from https://github.com/ChanR19/Research-Project/blob/master/Step%201 
7. Go to File>Settings>Project:(what you named it)>Project Interpreter and click on the green + button on the top right corner.
8. Type in "wget" and click on Install Package on the bottom left corner
^ Is setup and dosen't need to be done again
9. To run the program, click on Run>Run (ontop of Debug)>What you named the Python File
10. Follow the instructions from the program
